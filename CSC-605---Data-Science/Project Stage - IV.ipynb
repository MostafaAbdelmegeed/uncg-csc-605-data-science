    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: (70 pts)\n",
    "- Team: (30)\n",
    "    - Develop Linear and Non-Linear (polynomial) regression models for predicting cases and deaths in US. \n",
    "        - Start your data from the first day of infections in US. X-Axis - number of days since the first case, Y-Axis - number of new cases and deaths.\n",
    "        - Calculate and report Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for your models (linear and non-linear). Discuss bias versus variance tradeoff.\n",
    "        - Plot trend line along for the data along with the forecast of 1 week ahead. \n",
    "        - Describe the trends as compared to other countries. \n",
    "- Member: (40 pts)\n",
    "    - Utilize Linear and Non-Linear (polynomial) regression models to compare trends for a single state (each member should choose different state) and its counties (top 5 with highest number of cases). Start your data from the first day of infections. \n",
    "        - X-Axis - number of days since the first case, Y - Axis number of new cases and deaths. Calcluate error using RMSE.\n",
    "        - Identify which counties are most at risk. Model for top 5 counties with cases within a state and describe their trends.\n",
    "        - Utilize the hospital data to calculate the point of no return for a state. Use percentage occupancy / utilization to see which states are close and what their trend looks like.\n",
    "        - Perform hypothesis tests on questions identified in Stage II\n",
    "            - e.x. *Does higher employment data (overall employment numbers) lead to higher covid case numbers or more rapid increase in covid cases.*. Here you would compare the covid cases to the state or county level enrichment data to prove or disprove your null hypothesis. In this case there will be a two tail - two sample t-test to see if there is a difference and then one-tail - two sample t-test to show higher or lower.\n",
    "        - Depending on your type of data you can also perform Chi-square test for categorical hypothesis testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Task 2: (30 pts)\n",
    "- Member:\n",
    "    - For each of the aforemention analysis plot graphs,\n",
    "        - trend line\n",
    "        - confidence intervals (error in prediction)\n",
    "        - prediction path (forecast)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable**\n",
