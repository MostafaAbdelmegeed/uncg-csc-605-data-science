    "Coronavirus is a continuing worldwide pandemic, which has affected a lot of people including you. Our goal of the project in this class is to develop an analytical framework to study the data coming from United States to understand patterns of COVID-19 effect and spread. \n",

The underlying data is available for download below the US county map and has helped government agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its nationwide efforts.\n",
